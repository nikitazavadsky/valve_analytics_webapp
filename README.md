### Pre-requirements

1. Codestyle checks with `pre-commit`

* Install `pre-commit` package using `pip`

    Use the following command on in the root project directory

    ```bash
    pre-commit install
    ```

    It will install pre-commit hooks, that will automatically apply linters, described in the *.pre-commit-config.yaml* file, when you'll try to commit your changes
